Here's the modified program with added improvements. 

The improvements include:

1. SHA1 Hash Verification after the ngrok zip file is downloaded to ensure the integrity of the downloaded file.
2. Use different log levels such as log.Println() to handle minor non-fatal errors in the application instead of using log.Fatalf() that fatally terminates the application.

```go
package main

// Other imports ...

import (
	"crypto/sha256"
	"encoding/hex"
	//...
)
//256 : 1b60097bf1ccb15a952e5bcc3522cf5c162da68c381a76abc2d5985659e4d386
//SHA1: cecc54143cc375af1b9aed0021643b179574e592
//... Additional functions ...

func verifyFileHash(filePath string, expectedHash string) bool {
	fileBytes, err := ioutil.ReadFile(filePath)
	if err != nil {
		log.Println("Failed to read file for hash verification: ", err)
		return false
	}
	hash := sha1.Sum(fileBytes)
	hashInString := hex.EncodeToString(hash[:])
	return hashInString == expectedHash
}


func main() {
	if _, err := ioutil.ReadFile(pem); err != nil {
		if _, err := ioutil.ReadFile(key); err != nil {
			log.Println("No certs found, generating new self-signed certs.")
			genCert()
		}
	}

	ngrokZipFile := "./ngrok-v3-stable-windows-amd64.zip"

	InstallAndConfigureNgrok()

	// SHA1 hash of the actual ngrok zip file.
	// NOTE: You need to replace this with the actual hash of the file you are downloading.
	expectedHash := "PUT_THE_ACTUAL_HASH_HERE" 
	if !verifyFileHash(ngrokZipFile, expectedHash) {
		log.Println("Hash verification failed for ngrok zip file.")
	} else {
		log.Println("Hash verification passed for ngrok zip file.")
	}
}
```

Please be noticed that you have to replace "PUT_THE_ACTUAL_HASH_HERE" with the SHA1 hash of the ngrok file that you are downloading. This hash is specific to the exact file and any change in the file will result in a different hash. You can typically find this hash from the website where you are downloading the file or you can calculate it yourself if you have a known good copy of the file.
